# Bitloop
Bitloop is Huge Secure Encryption And Decryption Data System 

Package:

                      pip install fernet

Description:



Thousands of encryption methods have been used in human history. Many of these were used for reasons of prohibition, clandestine or warfare. However, it is easily deciphered in today's technology due to the clarity in the encryption methods that have survived until today. We know the a lot of encrypted system but they easily cracked by the Intelligence Service or any crack systems.  The best way to prevent this is to solve it with the encryption method in the network environment and over and over.  So we can provide ourself by Bitloop. Bitloop is two time encrypted user any data and also give this encrypted data sha256 key id so that users using this id for decrypted the encrypted data. Also if users want remove the message on server they need just enter the key id and remove that. So we decide that  Bitloop is secure and flexible.
